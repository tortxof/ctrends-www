**Computer Trends** is a family owned and operated business that began in Spartanburg, S.C. in 1985.
We are conveniently located on 1237 Boiling Springs Road in Spartanburg, approximately one mile from Spartanburg Regional Hospital.

We are a full service computer dealer, offering experience in computer repair, internet service, networking, and onsite computer services.
We cater to small businesses as well as anyone in need of a local computer dealer.

Being in business since 1985 has allowed us the opportunity to become exposed to a variety of computer issues,
from viruses to computer hardware failures, network troubleshooting and many others.
So, whether you need viruses removed, data transferred, computers upgraded or just looking for some advice, please let us help.
